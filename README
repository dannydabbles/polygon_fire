Keyboard Controls:
       q= Quits program.
       \= toggle world axis on/off.
       r= reset model to initial position.
       p= toggles between Orthorgraphic and Perspective.
       += increases draw speed, fade speed, spread speed and length of 
       	  particle life.
       -= decreases draw speed, fade speed, spread speed and length of 
       	  particle life.

       Axis toggle keys:
       x= toggles transform axis to x.
       y= toggles transform axis to y.
       z= toggles transform axis to z.
       c= toggles rotation axis to x.
       v= toggles rotation axis to y.
       b= toggles rotation axis to z.
       " "=toggles firespread on/off.
       ;= toggles between wireframe and quads.
       f= toggles fire drawing on/off.
       g= toggles "burnt" polygon coloring on/off.
       t= toggles object drawing on/off.
       a= toggles camera strafing left.
       d= toggles camera strafing right.
       w= toggles camera movement forward.
       s= toggles camera movement backwards.
       j= toggles camera look left pivot at eye.
       l= tottles camera look right pivot at eye.
       i= toggles camera movement up in y.
       k= toggles camera movement down in y.
       
       NOTES: Starts in firespread off mode.
       	      x, y, z, c, v, and b keys to not work in conjunction.
              User must fully release both mouse button
	      and axis toggle keys before pressing a new
	      axis toggle key.
	      g only changes anythign when in quad mode.

Mouse Controls:
  left click= used in conjunction with x, y, z, c, v, or b as listed
              above, rotates model around object coordinate 
	      frame.
	    = When pressed directly on a polygon sets that polygon on fire.
    NOTES:  Will only see effect in quad burnt mode.  But does not mean does
    	    not take effect.

       
Platform: Unix.ic system

Compiler: G++

Description: This program uses openGL to create an object made of polygons.
	     It then subdivides those polygons to a predermined area and 
	     side length.  After at least one polygon is "set on fire" and
	     the game is released the fire will spread out from that polygon
	     along the whole object.

Problems:
	-Input files must contain only convex or flat Polygons.
	-When l or j is pressed the first time(or after reset) immedietly 
	 looks directly at x axis, could not fix.
	-Sometimes when camera is moved or object is moved picking(setting
	 polygons on fire) automatically occurs at the center of the screen.
	-Program is processer intensive.  Sprites will not run on some older
	 computers.  Everything runs slow on some older machines.
